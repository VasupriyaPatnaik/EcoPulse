# Forgot Password Implementation - EcoPulse

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive forgot password functionality with OTP verification for the EcoPulse application.

## Features
✅ **OTP-based Password Reset**: Secure 6-digit OTP sent via email
✅ **Multi-step Process**: Email → OTP Verification → Password Reset → Success
✅ **Email Templates**: Beautiful, branded email templates with clear instructions
✅ **Security**: OTP expires in 10 minutes, stored securely in database
✅ **User Experience**: Progress indicators, loading states, error handling
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
- Added `resetPasswordOTP` field to User model
- Added `resetPasswordExpires` field for OTP expiration
- Fields are cleared after successful password reset

### 2. API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Send OTP to email
- `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` - Verify OTP code
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Reset password with verified OTP

### 3. Email Service
- **Development**: Uses Ethereal Email (test service) with preview URLs
- **Production**: Configurable with Gmail/other SMTP providers
- **Fallback**: Console logging when email service unavailable
- **Templates**: Professional HTML email templates with branding

### 4. Security Features
- OTP expiration (10 minutes)
- Password validation (minimum 8 characters)
- Email validation and sanitization
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. ForgotPassword Component (`/forgot-password`)
- **Step 1**: Email input with validation
- **Step 2**: OTP verification with 6-digit input
- **Step 3**: New password creation with confirmation
- **Step 4**: Success confirmation with redirect to login

### 2. User Experience Features
- Progress indicators showing current step
- Loading states during API calls
- Success/error message handling
- Resend OTP functionality
- Back to login navigation
- Animated transitions with Framer Motion

### 3. Integration
- Added forgot password link to login page
- Route configuration in App.js
- Responsive design matching app theme

## Usage Flow

1. **User clicks "Forgot Password"** on login page
2. **Enters email address** and clicks "Send OTP"
3. **Receives email** with 6-digit OTP code
4. **Enters OTP** on verification page
5. **Creates new password** with confirmation
6. **Success page** redirects to login

## Email Configuration

### Development (Current Setup)
```javascript
// Uses Ethereal Email for testing
// Preview URLs logged to console
// No real emails sent
```

### Production Setup
```javascript
// Add to .env file:
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM="EcoPulse <noreply@ecopulse.com>"
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Testing the Feature

### 1. Navigate to Login
- Go to http://localhost:3000/login
- Click "Forgot password?" link

### 2. Test Flow
- Enter any email address (e.g., test@example.com)
- Check console for email preview URL
- Use OTP from email preview
- Create new password

### 3. Verify Reset
- Try logging in with new password
- Should work successfully

## Security Considerations

1. **OTP Expiration**: 10-minute window for security
2. **Single Use**: OTP is cleared after successful reset
3. **Password Validation**: Enforced minimum length and confirmation
4. **Rate Limiting**: Could be added to prevent abuse
5. **HTTPS**: Should be used in production for email transmission

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] SMS OTP option
- [ ] Rate limiting for OTP requests
- [ ] Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- [ ] Password strength indicator
- [ ] Remember password recovery preferences
- [ ] Admin dashboard for monitoring reset requests

## Environment Variables
```env
# Email Configuration (Production)
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM="EcoPulse <noreply@ecopulse.com>"
NODE_ENV=production

# Development uses test email service automatically
```

## Notes
- Current implementation uses test email service for development
- OTP is logged to console when email service is unavailable
- All passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens remain unchanged during password reset process
